defining the indidual types of CRDTs below, which are:
LWWReg: Last Writer Wins register, for document type data
PNCounter: Positive Negative counter, for shared counter
AWSet: Add Wins set, for adding or removing tags, like a todo list

getting the state CRDTs done for now, would like to do operational CRDTs soon
